# Weather_prediction
A Weather Prediction web application that provides real-time weather information based on the user's location. The application uses location-based data to display the current temperature, weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy), and a brief weather description for any given area.

Key Features:
Location-based Weather: Automatically detects the user's location (or allows manual input) to fetch weather details specific to that area.
Current Temperature: Displays the current temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.
Weather Conditions: Provides a description of the weather (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.).
Weather Icon: Displays a dynamic weather icon that corresponds to the current weather condition.
Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, ensuring it works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
Technologies Used:
HTML5: Structures the web page and user interface.
CSS3: Provides styling and ensures a user-friendly, responsive design.
JavaScript: Handles dynamic interactions, such as fetching weather data and updating the UI based on the user's location.
Weather API: Uses a third-party weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack, or similar) to fetch real-time weather data based on location.
How It Works:
Upon loading the page, the website either uses the user's device location (via geolocation API) or allows the user to manually enter a city or location.
The app fetches weather data from a weather API and displays the current temperature, weather condition, and a description of the weather.
The UI updates dynamically based on the weather data, displaying relevant weather icons and information.
This project demonstrates how to build a practical, real-time application that integrates external APIs to provide useful, location-based data to users.

This description is detailed yet concise, and it clearly outlines the features, technologies, and functionality of the weather prediction website. It is well-suited for a GitHub repository, providing enough context for other developers or users to understand the project quickly.
